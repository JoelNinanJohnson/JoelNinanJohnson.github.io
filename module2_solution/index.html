				Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
				But I'm only going to get this one chance
				Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
				Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
				If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
				And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
				You were just what the doctor ordered
				I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
				All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
				Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
				They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
				But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
				I got a laptop in my back pocket
				My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
				Got a fat knot from that rap profit
				Made a living and a killing off it
				Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
				With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
				I'm an MC still as honest
				But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
				This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
				You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat
				Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yackidy-yac
				And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
				That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
				Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
				Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
				How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
				Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
				It's actually disastrously bad
				For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as
				I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
				All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
				Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
				Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
				Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
				Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
				Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
				Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since

				MC's get taken to school with this music
				'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
				Now I lead a new school full of students
				Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
				-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
				Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
				To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
				Roll Hall of Fame
				Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
				Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
				On the wall of shame
				You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
				Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
				Little gay looking boy
				So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
				You witnessing a mass occur
				Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
				Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
				You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
				And a "way to go" from your label everyday looking boy
				Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
				I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
				I'mma work for everything I have
				Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
				Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
				To keep up with the same pace looking boy
